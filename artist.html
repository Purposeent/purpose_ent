            <p class="card-text">
              Born and Partially raised in bedstuy, Brooklyn by a single, hardworking
Trinidadian mother by the of name Carol, Samantha first realized that she
had a voice people wanted to hear at age 7. The youngest of 6 children she
had a very sheltered childhood and was extremely shy. The only time she
would sing out loud was at home. Her older brother Brent (or as the family
calls him Jomo) would play instrumentals from his sound system loudly and
she'd sing along or her mother would ask her to sing one of her favorite
songs "Not gon cry" by Mary J Blige. Most of her singing abilities came
from mimicking what she heard on the radio.
Samantha didn't actively start pursuing music until she was 9 years old in
the fourth grade. In the middle of the school year Carol had relocated the
family to Coney Island. Here Samantha joined the school choir at Shirley
Tanyhill (p.s.288) after being encouraged by vocal teachers Ms. Sands and
Mr. Peters. She learned music fundamentals and was officially introduced
to the performing arts. She enjoyed being in the chorus very much. She
forged new friendships, traveled to different places in New York, and
became a stronger more structured singer. However her stay at 288 was
short lived as she moved on to Mark Twain Junior highschool in the 6th
grade. This was her introduction to a more strict world of music. The
audition process was very competitive, however she made it in. Her first
year of tutelage was under Mr. Postel, a fun yet all business vocal teacher.
He widened his students understanding of music deeply and pushed for
them to mature as vocalists, showing them to read music and sing in other
languages. After Mark Twain her family relocated to Canaries and
Samantha auditioned for Brooklyn High School of the Arts and within her
four years there became a well rounded vocalist under the teachings of
Charlene Corbett. She left High school a strong alto versed in proper vocal
technique, gospel, Broadway, classical, and learning to sing in even more
languages as well. She was accepted into Long Island University where
she majored in music education and studied jazz under Gloria Cooper. This
is where she widened her range to soprano and broke out of her shyness.
Professor Cooper's Jazz ensemble had a mandatory solo assignment for
each student. For many years she had been blending in and now she was
tasked with standing out. During her first year in college she gave birth to
her darling son Jayden. She juggled school, work, and parenting with the
help of her mother and two older sisters Leslie and Summer. As she was
coming into her stride as a soloist she also started songwriting for a friend
by the name of Anthony (aka Ant) whom was introduced to her by a
coworker. He would provide her with instrumentals and they would record
with engineer/producer Timmy Hendrix. Over time her and Timmy
developed their own friendship and they began working together on songs.
She then started performing her written pieces at school and even winning
a competition with one song. After her third year at L.I.U. she went through
a rough patch at home and couldn't really cope with everything. This was
affecting her school grades so she decided to step away from classes for a
while. After doing so she started writing more and met her best friend
Shampaine at Timmy's studio who was also a singer/songwriter. They both
were introduced to Dj Uncle Tone, through Timmy, who facilitated
showcases for underground artists in the Lower eastside of Manhattan. At
first performing separately and eventually coming together to form the
group BlacC Shadez. Shampaine was more put together and outgoing as
an artist whereas Samantha, although less shy, was a bit rough around the
edges and wasn't really much of a performer. Shampaine pushed
Samantha and encouraged her to polish her look and "fake it til you make
it" on stage. Equipped with the confidence Shampaine drilled into her head
the duo performed at many showcases and open mics and Samantha
became better as an all around performer with each performance. After
about 3 to 4 years of performing BlacC Shadez took a hiatus, both ladies
focusing on song writing and personal artist development. At that point
Samantha was searching for her sound. In 2015 she teamed up with Billie
Wroteit, an old highschool friend, to form "The Verdict". The Verdict was a
writing team that often branched out and worked with other songwriters.
Billie was a songwriter and artist far longer than Samantha so she helped
Samantha how to think outside the box to conceptualize when songwriting.
Working with Billie is how Samantha found her sound, an eclectic pop/rock/
alternative/soul type. Much like her personal style her music is (as Bill
would say) "outside the box." Today Samantha is putting together her first
project working with writers like Billie, Eli. F, and Shampaine and producers
like Purpose Entertaiment and Playmore.

              “No one inspired me to sing, it's just something I always did.”
              <br>
              <br>
For Elijah Freeman that inspiration comes from within and is melodiously
vocalized quite naturally. His casual demeanor resonates with his 6’2” slender
frame. His insights flow subtlety into episodes conceptualized in the aspirations
and yearnings of Elli,a moniker and depiction of what and who he is as an artist.
The realization of this raw talent came to light in 5th grade for Elijah where he
remembers receiving accolades not only from his fellow classmates but from his
teachers as well, one of which exulted that he had an amazing singing voice.
Elijah wrote his first r&b song back then, titled “Be My Baby” to his childhood
crush, and has gone onto winning poetry contests, and singing in gospel choirs.
Elijah has since joined a group of writers that he has affiliated himself with over
the years. It is through this affiliation that he has developed a work ethic to
become a singer/songwriter fashioned in a style all his own, drawing and feeding
off fellow songwriters that are inspired from the likes of Usher, Musiq Soulchild,
India Arie, Boyz II Men and Brandy. Although Elijah highly regards these
successful artists and their styles he innately draws mostly from within so that, he
may stand just as uniquely amongst that list one day.
Elijah finds great solace particularly in the realm of songwriting and is a soulful
tenor in the booth. He has written songs recently for an up and coming Canadian
pop star Adriana Lombardo who found working with Elijah unfamiliarly
encouraging. His humility shows up prominently in his writing and his style is
easily set apart and is continuously evolving. He has brought this awe inspiring
work ethic to studios in Toronto, NYC, and Miami.
Elijah comes from a musical and poetic family and is the only singer he knows of
amongst the$ clan. The$ Brooklyn native who is in his early 20’s has performed at
times on stage for talent and fashion shows and is eager to blossom further with
future performances to the delight of his burgeoning fan base, drawing from
within what inspires as he makes his promising way into the industry of today’s
music.
